            <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I was born November 17, 1999 at St. Agnes Medical Center. I have a brother named Jessie, 
                	a sister named Zoe, a father named Ed, and a mother named Kimberly. Growing up as a child, 
                	there were not many kids in my neighborhood. To the dissappointment of my parents disappointment,
                	I didn’t make friends as a kid, favoring videogames instead. I liked playing videogames 
                	because I didn’t need other people to have a good time. I could be independent, something that 
                	defined me as a child.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Something that I would like to do when I graduate, and maybe after college, is to live in another 
                    country for a year. Many other places have such rich cultures, which I would like to really dive 
                    into. I would like to learn the language, try all the food, get a job, and really get to know the 
                    people who live there. I feel that an experience like this would be helpful in understanding the 
                    ideas and lifestyles of others.
                </p>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
                <h3>Long Term goals</h3>
                <p>
                    My long-term goals are to go to college, find a job I can do while spending time with my family, 
                    and retire at an early age. At college, I may try to get a degree in either business or computer 
                    science. Some of the colleges I may be interested in are Fresno State, Cal Poly, MIT or Cal Tech.     Working with a 
                    business may be hard, because I would not be able to spend as much time with my family, but it 
                    might be more fulfilling for me. On the other hand, if I go into a technology job, such as 
                    coding, I would probably be able to work from home, and spend extra time with my (maybe) kids 
                    and wife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I retire, I would like to spend some time giving back to the community. My grandfather and 
                    uncle are veterans, so I have always had a passion to help those who fought for the freedom of 
                    our country. I think it may be fun to travel more after I retire. Going somewhere, such as South 
                    America or Japan, to teach English possibly, would be a cool way to both travel, as well as to 
                    help others.
                </p>
                <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    My short-term goals would be to get my license, build my own computer, get a job, get a car, 
                    and graduate high school. So far, I am on track to get my license on November 18, a day after 
                    my birthday. Recently, I have been working on finding a car, not a new one, but a Junker I can 
                    afford and will last long enough for me to work at a job. So far I am doing a good job in school 
                    and will be able to graduate in 3 years. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also been looking into different job opportunities. I know a lot of people with 
                    connections to places where young people can get jobs. For example, my sister is good friends 
                    with a manager at a target near my house that probably would be willing to give me a job. Also, 
                    I have a cousin that works at In N Out, who would also probably be nice enough to give me a job.
